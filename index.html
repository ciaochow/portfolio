      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm an aspiring Web Developer who is passionate, persistent, articulate and detail-oriented.  As someone with a previous engineering background, I love to know how and why things work.  I never say no to a challenge.  By nature, I am an information sponge and like to learn about new things.  Knowledge is education.  Education is power and leads to one's ability to think for themselves, be independent as well as being self-sufficient.</p>

      <h1>More About Me</h1>

      <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>

      <p>Travel.  There are some pretty amazing places in this world and I aim to see as many of them as possible!  I enjoy learning about other cultures, other people, the food they make etc. I have traveled to at least one country in every continent. Having lived in both London, UK and Hong Kong, I am fortunate to have made some good friendships while overseas; I have some unique insights into how the world operates and have seen some very special things.  The best way to travel internationlly is to make friends with locals as they always have a better perspective and can recommend stuff that the average tourist doesn't even know about.</p>

      <p>Scuba diving. I love the ocean, what can I say??  Having dived in five continents, the big animals (manta rays, whalesharks, dolphins, other sharks) are probably my favorite, but I love everything in the ocean just the same.  The multi-day liveaboard boat trips with multiple dives are the best.  I once wanted to be a marine biologist and am very keen on conservation.  It's such a shame on what is happening to the world's reefs as well as what's happening due to overfishing.  Yes, we've been to the moon; however, we've explored less than 5% of the ocean!  Don't you think there's something wrong with that??</p>

      <p>Genealogy (family tree research).  I am the genealogy guru in my family and have done physical research in three countries.  In addition, I have re-established ties with many long-lost cousins and organized various family reunions. Some of my findings go back to the 1500's.</p>
    
      <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>

      <p>To work independently, remotely and be able to freelance from anywhere.  I like the idea of being mobile and not tied down to any particular location.</p>

      <h2>What's your background?</h2>

      <p>I have been into computers since around age 7 and did some simple programs starting around age 12.  I got more involved with computers in both my high school newspaper/yearbook classes as well as when I created a webpage for a reunion.  Technology and computers have always fascinated me and I enjoy the challenges that go along with them.  With Web Development, one gets the unique opportunity to create things and to give/receive good advice on a project; in a normal workplace environment, this is not always the case.</p>
